# DEX Indexer and GraphQL API with Apibara

This repository shows how to use Apibara to index a decentralized exchange (DEX) and build a GraphQL API.

This project separates the indexer from the API server so that it becomes easier to deploy and scale in a production environment.

You should always run a single instance of the indexer but can run multiple API servers side by side to serve more users.

The project uses:

 * the [Apibara Python SDK](https://www.apibara.com/docs/python-sdk) for receiving StarkNet data.
 * MongoDB for storage.
 * [Strawberry GraphQL](https://strawberry.rocks/) for the GraphQL API server.


## Setting up

Create a new virtual environment for this project. While this step is not required, it is _highly recommended_ to avoid conflicts between different installed packages.

    python3 -m venv venv

Then activate the virtual environment.

    source venv/bin/activate

Then install `poetry` and use it to install the package dependencies.

    python3 -m pip install poetry
    poetry install

Start MongoDB using the provided `docker-compose` file:

    docker-compose up

Notice that you can use any managed MongoDB like MongoDB Atlas.


## Getting started

This example shows how to index JediSwap on StarkNet. You can change it to index any Uniswap-V2-like DEX by changing the configuration in `src/swap/indexer/jediswap.py`.

Once setup, start indexing by running the following command:

```sh
poetry run swap-indexer indexer
```

where you need to set following environment variables:

 * `SERVER_URL`: the Apibara server, should be `mainnet.starknet.a5a.ch`.
 * `MONGO_URL`: mongodb connection url. If you use the provided docker compose file use `mongodb://apibara:apibara@localhost:27017`.
 * `RPC_URL`: the StarkNet RPC url. You can use Infura for this.

The indexer will then start indexing your DEX.

Start the GraphQL API server with:

```sh
poetry run swap-indexer server
```

where environment variable `MONGO_URL` is the same connection string you used above.
The GraphQL API is served at `http://localhost:8000/graphql` and
it includes a GrapihQL page for testing the API.


## Production deployment & scaling

The repository contains a `docker-compose.prod.yml` file with a good starting point for a production deployment.

Here are some changes you should be considering:

 * Use a managed MongoDB, for example MongoDB Atlas.
 * Run the indexer and the API server on separate machines.


As the number of users grows, you may need to scale your API server:

 * Deploy multiple instances of the API server behind a load balancer.
 * Replicate the database and connect the API servers to the replicas.
 * Cache entities with e.g. redis.
